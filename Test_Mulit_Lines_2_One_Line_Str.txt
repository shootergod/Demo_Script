The use of vectors, matrices, and tensors is of fundamental importance in engineering 
analysis because it is only with the use of these quantities that the complete solution process 
can be expressed in a compact and elegant manner. The objective of this chapter is to 
present the fundamentals of matrices and tensors, with emphasis on those aspects that are 
important in finite element analysis. 
From a simplistic point of view, mattices can simply be taken as ordered arrays of 
numbers that are subjected to specific rules of addition, multiplication, and so on. It is of 
course important to be thoroughly familiar with these rules, and we review them in this 
chapter. 
However, by far more interesting aspects of matrices and matrix algebra are recog- 
nized when we study how the elements of matrices are derived in the analysis of a physical 
problem and why the rules of matrix algebra are actually applicable. In this context, the use 
of tensors and their matrix representations are important and provide a most interesting 
subject of study. 
Of course, only a rather limited discussion of matrices and tensors is given here, but 
we hope that the focused practical treatment will provide a strong basis for understanding 
the finite element formulations given later.
